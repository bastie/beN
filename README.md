# beNerger teaser

beNerger (short beN) is a algorithm to compress data like Blockchain, called Micro-Blockchain. It is other - other than zlib or deflate, xz, rar etc.  

## Motivation

End of 2020, the local NAS is annoying again because the storage space is running out. Shit!
The RAID has been deactivated for almost a year and compression with [zlib](https://zlib.net), [zip](http://infozip.sourceforge.net), [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) or [xz](https://tukaani.org/xz/) is no alternative. 

A new network storage is needed, **the last** network storage!

Eleven months later, a good dozen of proof of concepts, the beN algorithm is near. A modified blockchain algorithm, **Micro-Blockchain**, not designed to mine Bitcoin or other crypto currencies but to compress data. No algorithm for single-core or multi-core computers, **many-core** capable, state-of-the-art , GPU says hello!

## Technical overview
*beN* enables recursively an almost unlimited compression of any data stream. Based on established technologies such as modified blockchain, sorting and hash collisions calculation, lossy becomes lossless compression. The GPGPU and the parallel execution of hundreds and thousands of calculations allow an algorithm that would have taken an unacceptable amount of time just a few years ago. As a recursive algorithm, beN is also capable of streaming and allows you to compress and decompress a data stream from the beginning, even with highly compressed data, without knowing the entire data. Also tables as with [Huffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) based compressions are not needed.
